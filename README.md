placeGoat
=========

Placeholder services are cool. Goats are cool (Especially those yelling ones). placeGoat combines those two things.

Technologies
------------
I wanted to learn some new software while strengthing my knowledge in others, so placeGoat is built with PHP and the [Slim framework](https://github.com/codeguy/Slim). The server itself is running nginx on an Amazon ec2 micro instance.

### TO-DO
* Add more goats
* Add a goat counter
* ~~Also, some yaks~~
