placepig
=========

Placeholder services are cool. pigs are cool (Especially those yelling ones). placepig combines those two things.

Technologies
------------
Turns out hosting an EC2 instance is expensive, and I've switched to Node.js primarily, so I rebuilt this in Node and it's running on Heroku.
~~I wanted to learn some new software while strengthing my knowledge in others, so placepig is built with PHP and the [Slim framework](https://github.com/codeguy/Slim). The server itself is running nginx on an Amazon ec2 micro instance.~~

### TO-DO
* ~~Add more pigs~~
* ~~Add a pig counter~~
* ~~Also, some yaks~~
